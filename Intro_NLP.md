### Introduction


Natural language processing or NLP is a subfield of natural languages and computer science that studies the interactions between human language and computer systems. The field is also known as computational linguistics and artificial intelligence in the linguistic domain.

NLP primarily relates to applications of natural language processing in languages like English or French primarily for use by humans. But with NLP evolution, there are new potential applications for natural language processing in fields such as law enforcement analysis with criminal profiles, medical diagnosis, and treatment with personalized medicine dashboards.

-   History of NLP

The evolution of NLP is an ongoing process. The earliest work of NLP started as machine translation, which was simplistic in approach. The idea was to convert one human language into another, and it began with converting Russian into English. This led to converting human language into computer language and vice versa.

In 1952, Bell Labs created Audrey, the first speech recognition system. It could recognize all ten numerical digits. However, it was abandoned because it was faster to input telephone numbers with a finger. In 1962 IBM demonstrated a shoebox-sized machine capable of recognizing 16 words.

-   Various NLP Algorithms

The evolution of NLP has happened with time and advancements in [language technology](https://www.peppercontent.io/blog/what-is-language-technology). Data scientists developed some powerful algorithms along the way; some of them are as follows:

-   Bag of words: This model counts the frequency of each unique word in an article. This is done to train machines to understand the similarity of words. However, millions of individual words are in millions of documents; hence, maintaining such vast data is practically unimaginable.
-   TF-IDF: TF (term frequency) is calculated as the number of times a certain term appears out of the number of terms present in the document. This system also eliminates “stop words,” like “is,” “a,” “the,” etc.
-   Co-occurrence matrix: This model was developed since the previous models could not solve the problem of semantic ambiguity. It tracked the context of the text but required a lot of memory to store all the data.
-   Transformer models: This is the encoder and decoder model that uses attention to train the machines that imitate human attention faster. BERT, developed by Google based on this model, has been phenomenal in revolutionizing NLP.

Carnegie Mellon University and Google have developed XLNet, another attention network-based model that has supposedly outperformed BERT in 20 tasks. BERT has exponentially improved search results on browsers. Megatron and GPT-3 are based on this architecture used in speech synthesis and image processing.

In this encoder-decoder model, the encoder tells the machine what it should think and remember from the text. The decoder uses those thoughts to decide the appropriate reply and action.

For example, in the sentence “I would like some strawberry___.” The ideal words for this blank would be “cake” or “milkshake.” In this sentence, the encoder focuses on the word strawberry, and the decoder pulls the right word from a cluster of terms related to strawberry.

### Conclusion

Thus, NLP treats natural languages like Lego and makes computers adept at understanding and processing human languages. This enables machines to answer questions and obey commands.

Virtual assistants are the most exemplary contribution to natural language processing and benchmark how far NLP evolution has come. By studying the evolution of NLP, data scientists can predict what form this fascinating branch of IA will take in the future.
